# Author's Preface

This repository is the embodiment of all the pain I felt for 5 and a half months of Data Structures and Algorithms in college. To the future batches who are taking this cursed course and come across this repo, use it well and make me proud. Always look for the light at the end of the tunnel. If I can pass, then so can you. I wish you the best.
